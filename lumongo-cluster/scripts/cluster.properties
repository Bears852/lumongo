#should be smaller than the actual power of 2

#maximum number of blocks in memory allowed per node
#the more blocks in memory the faster LuMongo runs
#indexBlockSize*maxIndexBlock is approximately the max size used for index block cache
#there is also a NRT cache and an index writer buffer per segment
#and also a query and document cache that will take heap space
#In the case of out of memory exceptions increase the JVM size, add more nodes,
#or decrease this size
#Recommended Starting Points:
#  with 32k blocks use 37500 for 2GB JVM Size
#  with 32k blocks use 75000 for 4GB JVM Size
#  with 32k blocks use 150000 for 8GB JVM Size
