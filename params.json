LuMongo is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally across servers. LuMongo provides the flexibility and power of Lucene queries with the scalability and ease of use of MongoDB. By intelligently leveraging MongoDB, LuMongo is able to make Lucene scale without sacrificing Lucene's rich query syntax and without degrading MongoDB's scalability.\r\n\r\n## LuMongo is:\r\n* Realtime\r\n* Distributed\r\n* Pure Java\r\n* Open Source\r\n\r\n## LuMongo supports:\r\n* Sorting\r\n* Faceting\r\n* Searching multiple indexes with a single query\r\n* Storing associated documents with the documents\r\n\r\nTo learn more see the [wiki](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki):\r\n* [Overview](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Overview)\r\n* [Cluster](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Cluster)\r\n* [Command Line Tools](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Command-Line-Tools)\r\n* [Distributed Directory](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Distributed-Directory)\r\n* [Java Client](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Java-Client)\r\n* [Maven/Gradle](https://github.com/lumongo/lumongo/wiki/Maven) \r\n","google":"UA-31794149-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
